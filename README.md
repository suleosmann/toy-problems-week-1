Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program determines if a car is speeding and calculates demerit points based on the car's speed.

If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok."

If the speed is 70 km/h or more, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended."

How to Use
Run the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser console or Node.js).

Enter the car's speed when prompted.

The program will determine the outcome based on the speed and display the result on the console.

Example
If the car's speed is 80 km/h, the program will display:
