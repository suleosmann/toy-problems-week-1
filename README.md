# Suleiman Osman's JavaScript Challenges

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

This program calculates and displays a student's grade based on their input marks. The grading scale is as follows:

- A: Marks greater than or equal to 80
- B: Marks between 60 and 79 (inclusive)
- C: Marks between 50 and 59 (inclusive)
- D: Marks between 40 and 49 (inclusive)
- E: Marks less than 40

### How to Use

1. Run the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser console or Node.js).
2. Enter the student's marks when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the grade and display it on the console.

### Example

If the student enters marks as 75, the program will display:
Grade: B

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This program determines if a car is speeding and calculates demerit points based on the car's speed.

- If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok."
- If the speed is 70 km/h or more, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended."

### How to Use

1. Run the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser console or Node.js).
2. Enter the car's speed when prompted.
3. The program will determine the outcome based on the speed and display the result on the console.

### Example

If the car's speed is 80 km/h, the program will display:

Points: 2


## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual's net salary by taking inputs of basic salary and benefits. It also calculates payee (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary based on predefined values.

### How to Use

1. Run the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser console or Node.js).
2. Enter the basic salary and benefits when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the following:
   - Gross salary
   - Payee (Tax)
   - NHIF Deductions
   - NSSF Deductions
   - Net salary

### Example

If the basic salary is 50000 and benefits are 10000, the program will display:

Gross Salary: 60000
Payee (Tax): 12000
NHIF Deductions: 500
NSSF Deductions: 600
Net Salary: 47400
